    <h3>My Project and Plan</h3>
    <h4>Online</h4>
    <p>The online aspect of my plan is to become an expert in full-stack web development and to be very good at designing. Currently, I am in stage 1 of 10 stages in becoming a full-stack web developer. In graphic design, I am an intermediate.<br>
    After completing the learning stages, my plan is to build an app that solves real problems or accelerates solutions. Secondly, to work as a freelancer to gain more experience. I also plan to learn C++ and other ethical hacking languages to level up my skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Physical</h4>
    <p>The physical aspect of my plan is also very important. I donâ€™t want to be just the guy always seen on his laptop. I want to invest my income into the textile business, own a large textile company, and multiple laundry homes. I also plan to channel my money into farming. It has been my dream for a very long time to own one of the biggest food-producing farms in the world.</p>
